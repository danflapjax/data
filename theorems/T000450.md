Indiscrete spaces with multiple points cannot be {P47} (see [search for `Indiscrete + Totally Disconnected + Has multiple points`](https://topology.pi-base.org/spaces?q=Indiscrete+%2B+Totally+Disconnected+%2B+Has+multiple+points)), yet these are what are formed by removing any point from an indiscrete space with 3 or more points. Thus, the latter have no dispersion points.
