A local basis for each point $p\in X$ is the set of open intervals containing $p$ $\mathcal B_p=\{(a,b)\mid a<p<b; a,b\in X\cup\{-\infty,\infty\}\}$.
To construct a subbasis that is totally ordered by set inclusion, take any two (possibly) transfinite sequences $a:\Gamma\rightarrow[-\infty,p)$ and $b:\Gamma\rightarrow(p,\infty]$ that are monotonic and surjective with $a_0=-\infty$ and $b_0=\infty$.
Then $\mathcal B_p'=\{(a_\alpha,b_\alpha)\mid\alpha\in\Gamma\}$ is totally ordered and a local basis as $\mathcal B_p'\subseteq \mathcal B_p$ and any set in $\mathcal B_p$ has a subset in $\mathcal B_p'$.
